**E-Commerce Consumer Behavior Analysis (Excel)**
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce consumer behavior using Microsoft Excel to understand how demographics, purchasing behavior, discounts, 
loyalty programs, and decision time influence purchase value and customer satisfaction.The goal is to move beyond descriptive reporting
and extract business-relevant insights that can support marketing, pricing, and customer engagement strategies.

🎯** Business Objectives**

The analysis focuses on answering the following business questions:
What factors influence higher purchase value?
How do discounts and loyalty programs impact spending behavior?
Do customer demographics affect purchasing patterns?
Does decision time influence how much customers spend?
Which customer segments show higher satisfaction and engagement?

📂** Dataset Description**

Records: 1,000 customer purchase observations
Data Type: Consumer behavior & purchase data
Granularity: One row per customer purchase

**Key Attributes:**

Demographics (Age, Gender, Income, Education, Occupation)
Purchase details (Category, Purchase Amount, Payment Method)
Behavioral factors (Time to Decision, Engagement with Ads)
Loyalty & discounts
Customer satisfaction
This dataset is best suited for behavioral and segmentation analysis, not time-based retention modeling.

🧹** Data Preparation & Structuring**

The dataset was prepared using Excel with the following steps:
Preserved original data in a raw data sheet
Cleaned and standardized formats (dates, currency, text fields)
Validated categorical values (Discount Used, Loyalty Membership)
Created structured fact and derived metric sheets to support analysis
Avoided premature aggregation to maintain analytical flexibility

🧮 ** Derived Metrics & Segmentation **

To enable deeper analysis, several derived fields were created, including:
Age Groups (Young / Adult / Senior)
Purchase Value Bands (Low / Medium / High)
Decision Speed Categories (Fast / Medium / Slow)
Loyalty Segments (Member vs Non-Member)
Satisfaction Bands (Low / Medium / High)
Purchase Month and Year
These derived metrics allow meaningful comparisons across customer segments.

📊 ** Key KPIs Designed **

Total Revenue
Average Purchase Value
Percentage of Discounted Purchases
Revenue Contribution from Loyalty Members
Average Customer Satisfaction Score
Average Time to Decision
KPIs were designed to be decision-oriented, not just descriptive.

📈 ** Analytical Approach **

The analysis was conducted using Pivot Tables to explore relationships between:
Demographics vs Purchase Value
Discounts vs Average Spend
Loyalty Membership vs Satisfaction
Time to Decision vs Purchase Amount
Device Usage vs Revenue
Engagement with Ads vs Spending Behavior
Each pivot table was built to answer one clear business question.

🔍 ** Key Insights **

Loyalty members generate higher average purchase value, indicating that loyalty programs attract higher-value customers.
Discounts increase purchase frequency but lower average purchase value, suggesting margin trade-offs.
Customers who decide faster tend to spend more per purchase, indicating impulse-driven behavior.
Higher income groups show both higher spending and higher satisfaction, making them ideal targets for premium offerings.
Mobile users account for a significant share of purchases, reinforcing the importance of mobile-optimized experiences.

💡 ** Business Recommendations **

Focus loyalty programs on high-value customer segments rather than mass enrollment.
Use discounts strategically for slow-decision customers instead of across all segments.
Target fast-decision customers with limited-time premium offers.
Prioritize mobile user experience improvements to support high-engagement customers.
Tailor marketing messages based on income and satisfaction segments.

🛠 ** Tools & Techniques Used **

Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
Derived metrics and segmentation
KPI design
Analytical storytelling and business interpretation

⚠️ ** Limitations & Assumptions **

The dataset represents a snapshot of customer behavior, not long-term retention.
No transaction history across multiple purchases per customer.
External factors (seasonality, promotions outside dataset) are not included.

🏁** Conclusion **
This project demonstrates the ability to perform end-to-end Excel analysis, from data preparation and metric design to 
insight generation and business recommendations. It highlights analytical thinking, structured problem-solving, 
and the ability to translate data into actionable insights.
