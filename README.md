2 .  Sales Performance Analytics Dashboard

Project Description:
  Executive-level Excel analysis examining the impact of customer demographics, loyalty programs, discounts, and purchase decision time on revenue and satisfaction. The analysis highlights that loyalty members and fast-decision customers drive higher purchase value, while broad discounting compresses spend, supporting the need for targeted loyalty-led and data-driven promotional strategies.

  Key Insights:
 Loyalty members generate higher average purchase value, indicating that loyalty programs attract higher-value customers.
Discounts increase purchase frequency but lower average purchase value, suggesting margin trade-offs.
Customers who decide faster tend to spend more per purchase, indicating impulse-driven behavior.
