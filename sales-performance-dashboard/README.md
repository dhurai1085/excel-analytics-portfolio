📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-scale Excel data analytics solution designed to analyze sales performance, profitability, discount impact, and customer contribution.
It demonstrates end-to-end Excel analytics skills — from data modeling and derived metrics to interactive dashboards and business insights.
The project is built using Excel Data Model, Pivot Tables, slicers, and KPI design, following real-world analytical best practices.

🎯 Business Objectives

The dashboard answers key business questions such as:
How is revenue and profit trending over time?
Which categories and sub-categories drive profitability?
How do discounts impact profit margins?
Which customers contribute the most to total revenue (Pareto analysis)?
Is revenue concentrated among a small customer segment?

🧮 Key Metrics Designed

Total Revenue
Total Profit
Profit Margin (%) (calculated as Total Profit ÷ Total Revenue)
Total Customers
Customer Revenue Contribution (%)
Cumulative Revenue % (Pareto Analysis)

🧱 Data Model Architecture

The analysis is built using a structured data model:
Fact_Sales – transactional sales data
Dim_Date – date hierarchy for time analysis
Dim_Customer – customer-level attributes
Derived_Metrics – customer revenue aggregation & Pareto logic
All pivot tables and charts are connected through the Excel Data Model to ensure consistency and slicer synchronization.

🔍 Key Insights

Revenue remains stable across periods, but profit margins are thin, indicating cost or discount pressures.
Category performance varies significantly, with some categories generating high revenue but lower profitability.
Discounted sales increase revenue but compress profit, highlighting a trade-off between volume and margins.
Revenue follows the 80/20 rule, where a small group of customers contributes a majority of total revenue.
